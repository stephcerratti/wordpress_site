# wordpress_site
My first Wordpress site!

I think all my routing works, but I know the styling needs A LOT of work.  I was mostly concerned with re-facoritng my code 
to make sure most things were being loaded dynamically.  
I'm going to work on the styling during portfolio week. 

The Product Type links only work from the home page for now.
I am also missing the social links and the location map. 

If the site looks even remotely good in mobile or tablet, that is a huge coincidence because I have no responsive styling whatsoever.
.. I mean its magic.
